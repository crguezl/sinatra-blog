[See Dan Neumann blog](http://danneu.com/posts/15-a-simple-blog-with-sinatra-and-active-record-some-useful-tools/)

We'll be making a blog using Sinatra. 
It includes these features:

* Migrations: the ability to apply and rollback changes to our database (like creating our table of posts).
* Show all of our posts on our homepage
* Individual pages for each blog post
* Appropriate forms and buttons to create/update/destroy our blog posts
* Helper methods that let us simplify our templates.
* A place to put our static pages like "About Me".
* A RESTful interface.
* Layouts, partial templates, and regular templates.
* MVC pattern
* Validations on our posts
